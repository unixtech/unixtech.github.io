* **Relevant inline math**: `$`e=mc^2`$`

```
The area of a circle is :math:`A_\text{c} = (\pi/4) d^2`.
```

```
.. math::
  α_t(i) = P(O_1, O_2, … O_t, q_t = S_i λ)
```

`$`x^2`$`

`\begin{equation}` \label{eq} X^2 `\end{equation}`


`$`X^2 over \\pi`$`

`$`\ref{eq}`$`

\$\\alpha = 10^2\$

```
.. math::
\alpha = 10^2
```
`$$` \alpha = 10^2 `$$`
#Haal
This is best one yet

As of now Math Render is not working as expected just inquire down as to what has happened to it, If not for now then later on

```ALT```

`$\alpha$`
